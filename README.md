# Project overview and goals
This project was built and designed as a hotel management tool for customers and staff to manage room bookings, calculate bills, look over previous bookings, and more. The main goals for this project were using network requests so that we could retrieve data, using said data alongside object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation on the webpage and the self-created user interface, to write dry and reusable code, and to implement a robust testing suite that covers as much as the previous as is possible. o

## Technologies used
Our primary technologies used were the fetch api to post and get data, Mocha and Chai for testing our code, and webpack to amalgamate all of our javascript files into one, large singular file instead. 

## Challenges and Wins
Personally, my biggest challenges always tend to be my biggest wins as well, provided I actually find a solution at all. For this project, those challenges came in the form of the introduction of await/async into my workflow, and in designing separate test functions for when I couldn't properly test the functions proper; It was difficult to create something that mimicked the actual code closely enough that it would give proper feedback on when an error would or would not occur, while not using any of the fetched data that it would otherwise rely on. 
In the end, however, the difficulty was what made it rewarding, and after putting quite a few hours into both of the above challenges, I think I managed to pull both of them off pretty well!
